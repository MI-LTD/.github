### The AccuLoss¬Æ ALMS system is a complete transformer loss measuring system and is in compliance with the latest standards and specifications dealing with the calibration of test systems to measure transformer losses.
* There are two types of bushings available for the AccuLoss¬Æ system, vertical for systems at and above 58 kV L-N and horizontal for systems below 58 kV L-N. The AccuLoss¬Æ system includes powerful ‚Äúoperator friendly‚Äù software.
* Included are voltage and current waveform analysis, manual and fully automatic time-saving range selection and overvoltage and overcurrent protection.
* The AccuLoss¬Æ system controller can be directly connected to the plant LAN for transferring data to a host computer for backup and further processing including generating customer reports.
* As an option, AccuLoss¬Æ can be controlled remotely from a separate program running on another computer. This is very helpful in those situations when the power generator, which is not part of the loss measurement system, has to be controlled automatically and from a different location.
* The AccuLoss¬Æ system is a complete transformer loss measuring system and is in compliance with the latest standards and specifications dealing with the calibration of test systems to measure transformer losses.
